## Installation

We recommend using the ONCOLINER container or the provided [Dockerfile](../../Dockerfile)/[Singularity recipe](../../singularity.def) for building the whole ONCOLINER suite to avoid dependency issues.


## Usage

The main executable code is in the [`src/`](./src/) folder. The executable file is [`ui_main.py`](./src/ui_main.py).
